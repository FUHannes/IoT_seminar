\section{Introduction}
The quantum revolution is coming. With quantum computers\footnote{compare section \ref{quantum computing}} on the way to get more and more functional, people are fearing a loss of their security and privacy.
That is because there are algorithms based on Shors algorithm that can forge signatures and decrypt encrypted messages whos security is based on number theory problems.
The quantum computer only needs access to the public keys of these asymetric schemes.
The expenditure to forge a signature\footnote{that is considered secure under normal circumstances 
%TODO: more precise? Unforgeablu under chosen blabla
} with classic\footnote{we refer to classic if something is not directly leveraging entanglement or superposition} computers rises exponentially with increased key length, therefor beeing essentially unbreakable by classic computers.
A sufficient quantum computer on the other hand can derive a private key from a public key in polynomial time, therefor rendering these schemes broken.

That is why there are currently schemes under standarization\cite{PQClean-GH} that are based on other hard problems (not number theory) like so called lattice problems that cannot be that easily forged by quantum computers to save our privacy and security.

One of the use cases not directly comming to mind for the end user, but beeing as important non the less is signing sensitive sensor data in the Internet of Things (IoT).
Another problem coming up in the IoT compared to end-user-devices like Laptops and Smartphones though is the severe ressource contraintness. 
The IoT consist of low power devices with wery few storage and computing power.

In this paper i am going to evaluate existing signature schemes and their usage possibilities for the IoT regarding their performance metrics.

Therefor i am going to give a small introduction and background to quantum computing, beeing a little more detailed about their ability to break current encryption and signature standards.
In the next section i will give an overview over current candidates for Quantum Resistant (QR) Algorithms and giving performance metrics for those.
The following chapter will then focus on signature schemes in the IoT, starting with additional performance metrics relevant in the IoT.
With a little more details about two failed signature schmemes to highlight potetial pitfalls. 
And finally focussing on the best signature contenter for the IoT so far: FALCON.


% TODO ? Background section to put this in?
\section{Internet of Things}
%discussion what the boundries of iot compare different devices from linux devices rPI over 32bit Arm based processors with RTOS to 8bit microcontrollers like arduino/atmega
The IoT consists of devices of all sorts, having in common, that they communicate with each other and the enviroment rather than directly with humans.
Those devices range from automatic lights and smart home devices to tiny interconnected sensors in automatic fabrication.
A common characteristic though is, that most of these devices have limited processing power, flash storage and random access memory (RAM). 
A popular example for hobbiest IoT devices is the ESP32 from Espressif Microsystems.
They offer multiple Modules with up to 240Mhz Clock on the 32 IC, up to 16MB Flash Storage and 320KiB RAM.
Which is more than other compareable devices but way less then a lower spec modern smartphone, with 10 times the frequency, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage.
