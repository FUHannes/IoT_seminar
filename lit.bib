However, advances in quantum computers threaten to undermine the security assumptions upon which currently used public key cryptographic algorithms are based. In this paper, we provide a survey of some of the public key cryptographic algorithms that have been developed that, while not currently in widespread use, are believed to be resistant to quantum computing based attacks and discuss some of the issues that protocol designers may need to consider if there is a need to deploy these algorithms at some point in the future.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 8th Symposium on Identity and Trust on the Internet}, pages = {85–93}, numpages = {9}, keywords = {quantum computers, public key cryptography}, location = {Gaithersburg, Maryland, USA}, series = {IDtrust '09} }}
