While efficient implementations of the proposed schemes are somewhat included in the submission packages, certain issues like the threat of side-channel attacks are often lightly touched upon by the authors. Hence, the community is encouraged by the NIST to join the war effort to treat those peripheral, but nonetheless crucial, topics. In this paper, we study the lattice-based signature scheme qTESLA in the context of the masking countermeasure. Continuing a line of research opened by Barthe et al. at Eurocrypt 2018 with the masking of the GLP signature scheme, we extend and modify their work to mask qTESLA. Based on the work of Migliore et al. in ACNS 2019, we slightly modify the parameters to improve the masked performance while keeping the same security. The masking can be done at any order and specialized gadgets are used to get maximal efficiency at order 1. We implemented our countermeasure in the original code of the submission and performed tests at different orders to assess the feasibility of our technique.",isbn="978-3-030-42068-0"}

We provide full-fledged, constant-time portable C implementations consisting of only about 300 lines of C code, which showcases the code compactness of the scheme. Our results also demonstrate that a conservative, provably-secure signature scheme can be efficient and practical, even with a compact and portable implementation. For instance, our C-only implementation executes signing and verification in approximately 0.9 ms on an x64 Intel processor using the proposed level 1 parameter set. Finally, we also provide AVX2-optimized assembly implementations that achieve an additional factor-1.5 speedup.", isbn="978-3-030-57808-4" }
